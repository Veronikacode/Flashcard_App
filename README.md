# Flashcard_App

### About Project
An application that involves learning words from the Polish language.
The application shows the word in Polish and after 3 seconds converts it to English, when you know the word you click the green button, if not then the red one.
With this, the application saves the data to the file "words_to_learn.csv" and next time the words will be reduced by those learned.
